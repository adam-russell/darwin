New strategy for setting and using DARWINHOME

(1) At any point in the program the value of DARWINHOME is maintained in ...

    gOptions->mDarwinHome

(2) General strategy is this ...

-- Survey areas are self contained and contain ...
   catalog, tracedFins, matchQueues, matchQResults
   
-- Survey areas can be anywhere
   each is located inside some "current" DARWINHOME

   so we GROUP survey areas, each group having a single HOME

   DARWINHOME is the default location for creating, opening, etc BUT ...

   does NOT restrict placement 

-- In the CONFIGURATION file we must save a hierarchy of

   DARWINHOME
      SURVEYAREA-1
      SURVEYAREA-2

   the last open DATABASE and the SURVEY AREA and HOME within which
   the database is found are saved RELATIVE to each other

-- In the gOptions we have to store this same hierarchy

   typedef struct _SurveyAreaGroup {
      int mNumSurveyAreas;
      string mHomePath;
      vector<string> mAreaName;
   } SurveyAreaGroup;

   string mDarwinHome; // the current DARWINHOME

-- do we want to separate the drive from the DARWINHOME path?

   -- does this only pertain to PC / Windows

   if the path includes a drive letter it has "x:" a two character prefix
   and the second char is ':'

Note: paths on the Mac are like Linux paths

----- darwin 2.0 way of doing things

	// handle any/all command line arguments
	// here are the possible options (DARWIN 2.0)
	// --set-home="..."   this directly sets gOptions->mDarwinHome
	// --help             this invokes the command line help
	// --version          DARWIN returns the current version(s)
	// "*.finz"           DARWIN opens as a fin viewer for this Fin ONLY

	// DARWIN uses the following strategy to find its HOME path for this
	// invocation of the program
	// (1) if a --set-home option is found, then the specified path is used
	// (2) else if argv[0] contains a path, then that path is used
	// (3) else the current working directory is used
	//
	// (4) if a path is found in the darwin.cfg file AND it differs from any set above,
	//     then the user is querried for clarification????
	// (5) if the DARWINHOME and DATABASE paths in the darwin.cfg file differ
	//     then the user is querried for clarification????
	//
	// The environment variable DARWINHOME is no longer used in any way.

----- in darwin 2.0 these restrictions and assumptions are used

-- all new catalogs MUST be created within an existing or new survey area
-- all new survey areas MUST be created inside DARWINHOME
-- all backups are created in the DARWINHEOM/backups folder and are automatically named
-- all restores recreate exactly the same folder structure and catalog that was backed-up
   -- however, no traced fins, queues or match results are backed up or restored
-- attempts to open a ctalog (database) outside DARWINHOME were blocked in 2.0
   -- this has been changed (I think) in 2.22
-- the default folder for FINZ files is tracedFins within the current survey area, dtermined
   from the currently ope catalog, but the FINZ files may be saved anywhere, and the
   open file chooser remembers the last path used and returns to it
-- all match results files are saved in the current survey area matchQResults folder and are
   automatically named
-- names of catalog and unknown fin inside match results are a mess
   -- the finz may be in the current survey area
   -- in a different survey area in the same DARWINHOME
   -- in an arbitrary location
   -- ??

-- in config file 
   -- darwinhome is full path
   -- current survey area is full path
   -- database is full path
   -- we do keeplist of all known catalogs (just survey area name & database name)
   -- we do keep list of all known survey areas (just the names)
      -- the two items above are only used when creating new databse or importing a database

   perhaps the method of handling this is the same as we need for new DARWINHOME

potential problems when things get moved

-- we still have multiple databases within a single catalog folder
   -- should we change this
   -- doing so would allow us to import a catalog into an existing survey area
   -- doing so would make it easier to clean out orphaned images
   -- 



Strategy for determining DARWINHOME when program started

1) Let user choose location for new survey area using a file chooser strategy
2) Make all
