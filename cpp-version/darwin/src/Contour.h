// ***008OL - Notes on new use of Contour CLASS - 3/10/2005
//
// The Contour class is used ONLY in the initial identification
// of the fin outline.  This occurs in the TraceWindow.  The
// Contour points are initialized by the user trace of the fin,
// and are then repositioned (snapped to) the fin outline by
// the active contour (snake) code.  The user may reposition
// Contour points.  The Contour is then processed to remove knots,
// normalize its size, and evenly space the points.  Key features
// are located using the resulting Contour.  A Chain is created
// in this process.
//
// There is NO Contour kept for further use in the system after
// the TraceWindow processes are comlete.
// 
// It is possible that the finalized Contour could be made a part
// of the Outline CLASS which would allow it to passed thru the 
// system for use IF NEEDED.  That is NOT done at this time.
