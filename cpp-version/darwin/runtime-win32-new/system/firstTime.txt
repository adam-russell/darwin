This file exists until the first time DARWIN is run after installation.

If it is found, then DARWIN checks to see if the data path folder specified 
by the gOptions->mCurrentDataPath exits.  If not it is created and the 
surveyAreas ("default" and "sample") are MOVED from within the application 
folder hierarchy to the gOptions->mCurrentDataPath folder.  If so, then these survey areas are DELETED 
from within the application.

This file is then deleted, so that this test/move is not performed again.

Here is the series of actions to be performed on first run of DARWIN after
installation.

datapath = gOptions->mCurrentDataPath;
if (path does not exist)
  create path
if (path/surveyAreas doe not exist)
  create path/surveyAreas
if (path/backups does not exist)
  create path/backups
if (path/syrveyAreas/sample does not exist)
  move it from inside application
if (path/surveyAreas/default does not exist)
  move it from inside application
set current survey area to path/surveyAreas/default
remove this file
