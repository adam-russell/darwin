DARWIN 2.0 Warning (6/10/2009)
==============================

It has been determined that the "darwin-2.0-setup.exe" and 
"darwin-2.0-upgrade.exe" installers can be manipulated by a user determined 
to install DARWIN in a non-standard location in such a way as to remove the 
"darwin-2.0" folder that was intended to contain ALL of DARWIN's other 
folder structure.

This can result in the following folders and files being installed directly
in one of your EXISTING folders. If thes are in the "Program Files" or
"Windows" or "My Documents" folder without being contained inside the 
"darwin-2.0" folder you could lose non-DARWIN related programs or data if you
use DARWIN's uninstaller.

   FOLDERS
   -------
   system
   surveyAreas
   docs
   licenses-etc
   backups

   FILES
   -----
   fileassoc.nsh
   darwin-2.0-readme.txt
   license.rtf
   uninstall.exe

If you have ANY DOUBTS about how DARWIN was installed DO NOT use the
"uninstall.exe" program to uninstall DARWIN.  Doing so could result in 
loss of ALL other files in the installed loacation.  Instead, manually remove 
the DARWIN folders and files without running the uninstall.

To FIX this problem in all cases, you can download and run the 
"darwin-2.01-upgrade.exe" installer, which will fix several minor problems
with DARWIN itself AND will replace the "uninstall.exe" file with a SAFER
version.
