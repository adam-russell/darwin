----------------------------------------------------------
This is a freely distributable version of the DARWIN-1.75 software.

DARWIN (Digital Analysis and Recognition of Whales Images on a Network) has been
under development at Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, FL, since 1993.  Several
research versions have been presented at conferences and workshops over the 
intervening years.

The software was first demonstrated at the 11th Biennial Conference on the Biology 
of Marine Mammals, held in Orlando, FL, in 1995.

This software is provided for your use and evaluation.  Copies may be made
and the software may be in installed on any machine, free of charge.

CAUTION: THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND FUTURE VERSIONS ARE NOT
GUARANTEED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH VERSION 1.75 (beta). NO WARRANTEES OR GUARANTEES

From the CD.

	Copy the folder "darwin-1.75-beta" to a convenient location. NOTE: You will need 
	to have "Administrator" or "Power User" level privileges on your Windows 2000 
	or Windows XP computer if you want to copy the folder to "C:\Program Files" 
	or "C:\" 

The folder "darwin-1.75-beta" contains the following ....

	backup        - used in backing up database
	bin           - contains executable ("darwin.exe") and GTK+ dlls 
	catalog       - folder for catalog (will contain "darwin.db" and copies of 
	                dolphin images used in recognition)
	docs          - online user help and other documentation
	tracedFins    - folder for saved fin tracings
	matchQueues   - folder for queued matches 
	matchQResults - folder for saved results of fin matches
	etc           - GTK+ and other 
	lib           - GTK+ and other runtime library files
	samples       - sample catalog and images
	sightings     - folder for sighting information (for future versions)
	backupCatalog.bat  - creates backup copies of catalog, images and configuration
	restoreCatalog.bat - restores current catalog, images and configuration from
	                     previous backup
	README.txt    - this file
	runDarwin.bat - sets up runtime environment and starts executable

RUNNING Darwin
--------------

	To run the software, double-click on the "runDarwin.bat" file.

	It creates an essential runtime environment variable (DARWINHOME)
	and then runs the executable (bin\darwin.exe).

	The program will create an initial configuration file "darwin.cfg" containing
	various configurable color values, active contour constants, etc.  Most 
	importantly for the user, it saves the name and location of the catalog, and
	the number and names of the catalog categories. This is a text file and can
	be viewed or modified using and text editor (Wordpad, Word, ...).  The catalog 
	categories in this beta version are FIXED and are those used in the Eckerd 
	College / Tampa Bay dolphin catalog.  User selectable / configurable categories
	will be available in the next release of the software.

	The program will also create an empty catalog database "catalog\darwin.db"
	if none exists. Otherwise, it opens and loads the catalog specified in
	the configuration file.

Help / Documentation
--------------------
The "docs" folder contains an HTML User's Guide ("usersguide.htm").  You can open it
by double-clicking it, or you can access it from the Help/Documentation menu option
on the Main Window of the program.

Sample Catalog
--------------

	There is a sample catalog included in the samples folder.  You may find it
	useful to install this sample prior to using the software the first time. 
	Once you have explored the software, you can remove the sample catalog and
	rerun the program to start building your own catalog.

	To INSTALL the "sample" catalog ...
	
		double-click on the "samples\installSampleCatalog.bat" file.  
		
		It will back-up any existing catalog and configuration, then copy the 
		sample "darwin.db" file, associated images, and sample "darwin.cfg" 
		configuration file to the correct locations for the program to find 
		them the next time it is run.

	To UNINSTALL the "sample" catalog ...

		double-click on the "samples\UNinstallSampleCatalog.bat" file.  
		
		It will remove any existing catalog and configuration, then copy the 
		"backup\darwin.db" file, associated images, and "backup\darwin.cfg" 
		configuration file to the correct locations for the program to find 
		them the next time it is run.

	All sample dolphin images have been provided courtesy of the Eckerd College 
	Dolphin Project.


Supported Image File Formats
----------------------------
The program currently reads JPEG, BMP, PNM, PGM(ASCII & Raw formats) and PPM (Raw format)
image files.  A future version of the software will support uncompressed TIFF files.

Backup & Restore
----------------
Two utilities are provided for creating backups and restoring catalog, images and 
configuration from previous backups. Backups are kept in the "backup" folder and
are comprised of copies of "darwin.cfg" and the "catalog" folder.  The "backup" folder
contains a subfolder ("old") which contains a copy of the previous backup.

	To BACKUP the current catalog ...

		double-click on the "backupCatalog.bat" file.  

		This batch file does three things.
		(1) Erases any OLD backup copy in "backup\old"
		(2) Copies any existing backup ("backup\darwin.cfg" and "backup\catalog")
		to "backup\old"
		(3) Copies the current catalog ("darwin.cfg" and "catalog") to "backup"

	To RESTORE the current catalog from a previous backup ...

		double-click on the "restoreCatalog.bat" file.  

		This batch file does the following.
		(1) Erases the current catalog ("darwin.cfg" and "catalog")
		(2) Copies the existing backup ("backup\darwin.cfg" and "backup\catalog")
		into correct locations ("darwin.cfg" and "catalog") to restore the 
		current catalog to the previous state saved in the backup.

Security & Sharing Issues
------------------------
Windows XP (in particular) has tightened file sharing and security settings.  A
"normal" User is likely to have problems running the Darwin software, even if
he succeeded in installing it.  This problem has to do with default "write" and
"delete" privileges for normal users being denied in certain locations.

The main issues relate to the following ....

	The catalog ("catalog\darwin.db") and the configuration file ("darwin.cfg")
	must be opened in read/write mode since changes are made to it as the program 
	runs.  A normal User may not have write privileges if the software was 
	installed by a different user.

	If file write permissions are the problem the program will terminate with an
	error message "Error opening or creating darwin.db file!"

	Similar problems may be encountered by normal Users when trying to install 
	or uninstall the sample catalogs.

If you have "Administrator" or "Power User" privileges on your Windows XP machine
you should not encounter these problems.

If not, you will need to use the Windows XP File Sharing and Security settings
to permit "write" and "delete" access to the problem files.
