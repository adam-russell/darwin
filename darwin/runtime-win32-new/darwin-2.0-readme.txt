DARWIN 2.0 Beta Software (README FILE) -- 7/30/2008 - JHS
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a freely distributable version of the DARWIN-2.0 software.

DARWIN (Digital Analysis and Recognition of Whales Images on a Network) has
been under development at Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, FL, since 1993.
Several research versions have been presented at conferences and workshops
over the intervening years.

The software was first demonstrated at the 11th Biennial Conference on the
Biology of Marine Mammals, held in Orlando, FL, in 1995.

This software is provided for your use and evaluation.  Copies may be made
and the software may be in installed on any machine, free of charge.

RUNNING Darwin
--------------

    NOTE: There is no longer any runDarwin.bat file as was used in previous 
    versions. DARWIN may be started several ways.

    DARWIN creates the following START menu items.
        Backups --- A link to the DARWIN backup folder
        Darwin ---- this runs DARWIN 2.0
	Darwin Help -- this links to the DARWIN help (in HTML format)
	SurveyAreas -- this is a link to DARWIN's catalog and data folders
	UNINSTALL ---- this will uninstall DARWIN 2.0 (you have the option to 
	               save or remove your data)
	
    DARWIN creates the following Desktop Icon 
        darwin 2.0  -- double-click this to run DARWIN 2.0

    DARWIN 2.0 uses a NEW method of storing saved Fin Traces. These .FINZ
    files each contain the Fin Trace, a copy of the original image, and 
    a modified image reflecting any changes made using DARWIN's Trace 
    Window routines.  You may double-click on any .FINZ file and DARWIN
    will open as Fin Viewer.

    DARWIN no longer depends on any environment variables.  If you have
    a previous installation and have set an environment variable called
    DARWINHOME, you will probably want to remove it from your environment
    variable list.  

    The program will create an initial configuration file "darwin.cfg" 
    in the system folder the first time it runs.  This file contains 
    various configurable color values, active contour constants, etc.  
    Most importantly for the user, it saves the name and location of 
    all survey areas, catalogs, and catalog category naming schemes. 
    YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO CATALOGS OR DATA IF YOU MODIFIED THIS FILE 
    MANUALLY.  The only catalog category scheme included with the 
    software is the Eckerd College scheme.  However, you may create, 
    save and use additional schemes to create your own databases.

    IF THIS IS THE ***FIRST*** INSTALLATION OF DARWIN YOU HAVE USED ...

    The program will open the first time without a database.  We recommend 
    that you use the menu option "File/Open Database" to locate and open
    the "surveyAreas/sample/catalog/darwin.db" database.  There are also 
    "surveyAreas/sample/fin-images" which you may use to familiarize
    yourself with the software and its usage.

    When you are ready, you may use the menu option "File/New Database" to
    create a database of your own. You may create this database in the 
    "surveyAreas/default" folder or you may create a totally different survey
    area and database of your own.  The catalog category naming scheme you
    desire to use may be selected from a pull-down menu.  If you want to
    create your own scheme, do so by using the main window menu option 
    "Settings/Catalog Scheme/Define New Scheme" before you create the new
    database.  Once a new database is created, its category names are fixed
    and cannot be changed.
    
    IF YOU ***UPGRADED*** YOUR PREVIOUS VERSION OF DARWIN ...

    DARWIN will read your existing configuration file, and will attempt
    to open the database you last used with the OLDER version.  The database
    format has changed significantly, so you will be prompted to BACKUP and
    CONVERT your database to the new database format.  If you performed a
    BACKUP prior to INSTALLING DARWIN 2.0, then you can uncheck the
    backup related options.  Click OK to perform the conversion.  All
    subsequent access to this catalog (database) will be performed using
    DARWIN 2.0 and this new SQL compatible database.

    IF YOU ***INSTALLED*** DARWIN 2.0 IN A DIFFERENT FOLDER THAN YOUR OLDER 
    VERSION ...

    DARWIN 2.0 will create a new configuration file and will open without
    any open catalog.  Use the "File/Import/Import Catalog" menu option to
    open a file chooser, then find your BACKUP or EXPORT archive in your
    OLDER DARWIN folder's "backups" folder, and click "Open."  You will then
    be required to name a new Survey Area within which to complete
    the IMPORT of your catalog and then Click "OK."  The catalog will be
    imported into your new Survey Area. Since the catalog is being imported 
    from the older version of DARWIN, you will now be prompted to BACKUP and 
    CONVERT the database file to the new SQL compatible format.  Un-select 
    the backup options and click "OK."  Your catalog will now open normally, 
    and you can use it as you previously did using the older version of 
    DARWIN.

    WARNING: Do NOT open an OLD database in your old installation folder
    by using the "File/Open Database" option from DARWIN 2.0.  Although the
    conversion and opening will occur correctly, the location of the "new"
    database will still be in the "old" location, and will in fact destroy
    the "old" version of the database file.  This means you will NOT be able
    to go back and use the older version of DARWIN on the "old" database
    if you so desire in the future.  ALWAYS use the IMPORT process to move
    a catalog from an older version into DARWIN 2.0.

    NOTE: All catalogs (databases) created within a given survey area will
    share the same "catalog" folder.  This means that their database files
    and cataloged images will be mixed within the same folder.

    Whenever the program runs, several AUTOMATIC backups are created.  If you
    have a program crash and lose your configuration or a database, these 
    files may be useful in restoring your system.

    system/darwin.cfg.bak
        a copy of the last successfully loaded configuration file.  If the
        program cannot find "system/darwin.cfg" or if it is corrupted, the
        program will automatically restore "system/darwin.cfg" from 
        "system/darwin.cfg.bak" -- If this fails a new initial distribution
        "system/darwin.cfg" file is created.  You may rebuild the list of
        KNOWN databases, by opening each in turn the next time you run the
        program.  Category naming schemes will have to be manually rebuilt
        and saved.

    system/lastLoadOf_xxx_yyy.db
        a copy of the "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" database file made
        as it was last loaded.  This copy does not contain any changes made 
        to the database while the program was running.

        If the "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" file is lost or becomes
        corrupted, you may manually restore the catalog (database) to the
        same state it was in when last loaded by manually replacing the 
        "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" file with a COPY of the
        "system/lastLoadOf_xxx_yyy.db" file.

        If you have a more recent FULL BACKUP, you can accomplish the same
        thing by using the menu option "File/Restore" in the main window.
        FULL BACKUPS include all associated catalog images as well as the 
        *.db file.

Help / Documentation
--------------------
The "docs" folder contains an HTML User's Guide ("usersguide.htm").  You can
open it by double-clicking it, or you can access it from the menu option
"Help/Documentation" in the Main Window of the program.

Sample Catalog
--------------

There is a sample catalog included in the "surveyAreas/samples" folder. You
may find it useful to open this sample the first time you use the software.
All sample dolphin images have been provided courtesy of the Eckerd College
Dolphin Project.

Supported Image File Formats
----------------------------
The program currently reads JPEG, BMP, PNG, PNM, PGM(ASCII & Raw formats)
and PPM (Raw format) image files.  Other image formats will be supported
in future versions of the software as needs are identified.

EXIF data from JPEG files are automatically extracted and used to fill
sighting data entries wherever possible.  Currently the image creation
date/time is extracted and displayed when a new image is loaded into the
Trace Window for processing.

Backup & Restore
----------------
These processes have been provided in the software since version 1.85.
From the main window the user may make a backup of the CURRENTLY LOADED
database using the menu option "File/Backup."  The backup is created in
a standard location and is named automatically.  

Given the currently loaded database ...

    surveyAreas/default/catalog/darwin.db

a backup created today (5/15/2007) would be created as a zipped archive
containing the database file "darwin.db" and all associated images, and this
archive would be saved in the "backups" folder as ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007.zip

any subsequent backups created the same day would be stored with numeric 
suffixes as follows ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[2].zip
    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[3].zip

Backups must be manually removed when or if space becomes an issue.

If the user needs to restore a database from an existing backup, the menu 
option "File/Restore" from the main window allows selection of a backup 
file.  The catalog file and all associated images will be extracted from
the backup file (zipped archive) into exactly the same survey area from
which it came.

Given the selected backup archive ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[2].zip

The database file itself ...

    surveyAreas/default/catalog/darwin.db 

would be replaced with the copy from the archive.  Any missing images
associated with the database in the folder ...

   surveyAreas/default/catalog/

would also be replaced from the archive.  However, existing images
in the catalog folder will NOT be overwritten.

Export & Import of Catalogs
---------------------------
These processes are provided in the software beginning with version 1.85.
They are similar to Backup and Restore.  However, the user is allowed 
wider control over the location and naming of the zipped archive when
exporting, and a completely new survey area is required when importing.
Export and import are intended to allow movement of a catalog (database)
from one machine to another or one installation to another.

From the main window the user may export the CURRENTLY LOADED database
using the menu option "File/Export/Export Catalog."  A zipped archive 
containing the database file and all associated images is created in a 
location and with a name selected by the user.

From the main window the user may import an exported archive by using the
"File/Import/Import Catalog" menu option.  The user must then select the 
archive file to be imported AND enter a name for a new survey area within 
which to import the catalog.  Imports into existing survey areas are not 
allowed in this version of the software because of the difficulties 
associated with maintaining existing database associations with existing 
images while extracting large numbers of additional images into the catalog 
folder.

Export & Import of Finz
-----------------------
This is a NEW feature of DARWIN 2.0.  Individual TRACED FINS may now be 
exported from the CURRENTLY OPEN catalog or imported into the CURRENTLY
OPEN catalog. A new compressed archive version of a DARWIN Fin is created 
in a "*.finz" file.  This FINZ file contains the Fin outline, features, 
data and copies of both original and DARWIN modified images.  All older
style "*.fin" files can be loaded with DARWIN 2.0, but only FINZ files will
be created by this and later versions.

To Export a fin, select the "File/Export/Export Fin (*.finz)" menu option.
A scrollable list of fins in the database will appear.  You may select one 
or more fins from this list to be exported. Selection of a range of fins
is supported using the SHIFT key along with mouse clicks.  Selection of
multiple fins that are not in a contiguous range is supported using the
CTRL key along with mouse clicks.  If a single fin is selected and
"Save Fin(s)" is clicked, you will be provided with a file save dialog and
must type a name for the FINZ file and click "Save."  If multiple
fins are selected and "Save Fin(s)" is clicked, then you must select a 
folder into which the FINZ files will be saved and click "Save."  Filenames
are automatically created from the fin ID for each saved fin when exporting
multiple fins at once.

To Import a fin, select the "File/Import/Import Fin (*.finz) menu option.
An open file chooser will appear.  Select the fin or fins to be imported 
into the CURRENTLY OPEN catalog, and click "Open." The effect of importing
a fin or fins is the same as if each FINZ file had been opened using the
"File/Open Traced Fin" menu option, and had then clicked the "Add to Database"
button in the Trace Window.

Security & Sharing Issues
------------------------
Windows XP (in particular) has tightened file sharing and security settings.
A "normal" User is likely to have problems running the Darwin software, even
if he succeeded in installing it.  This problem has to do with default 
"write"and "delete" privileges for normal users being denied in certain 
locations.

The main issues relate to the following ....

    All catalogs ("catalog/*.db") and the configuration file ("darwin.cfg")
    must be opened in read  and write modes since changes are made to it as
    the program runs.  A normal User may not have write privileges if the
    software was installed by a different user.

    If file write permissions are the problem the program will most likely
    terminate with an error message "Error opening or creating database 
    file!"

If you have "Administrator" or "Power User" privileges on your Windows XP 
machine you should not encounter these problems.

If not, you will need to use the Windows XP File Sharing and Security 
settings to permit "write" and "delete" access to the problem files.
