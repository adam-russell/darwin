RUNNING Darwin
--------------

    To run the software, double-click on the "runDarwin.bat" file.

    It creates an essential runtime environment variable (DARWINHOME)
    and then runs the executable (bin\darwin.exe).

    The program will create an initial configuration file "darwin.cfg" 
    in the system folder.  It contains various configurable color values, 
    active contour constants, etc.  Most importantly for the user, it 
    saves the name and location of all survey areas, catalogs, and catalog
    category naming schemes. YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO CATALOGS OR DATA IF 
    YOU MODIFIED THIS FILE MANUALLY.  The only catalog category scheme
    included with the software is the Eckerd College scheme.  However, you
    may create, save and use additional schemes to create your own databases.

    The program will open the first time without a database.  We recommend 
    that you use the menu option "File/Open Database" to locate and open
    the "surveyAreas/sample/catalog/darwin.db" database.  There are also 
    "surveyAreas/sample/fin-images" which you may use to familiarize
    yourself with the software and its usage.

    When you are ready, you may use the menu option "File/New Database" to
    create a database of your own. You may create this database in the 
    "surveyAreas/default" folder or you may create a totally different survey
    area and database of your own.  The catalog category naming scheme you
    desire to use may be selected from a pull-down menu.  If you want to
    create your own scheme, do so by using the main window menu option 
    "Settings/Catalog Scheme/Define New Scheme" before you create the new
    database.  Once a new database is created, its category names are fixed
    and cannot be changed.
    
    NOTE: All catalogs (databases) created within a given survey area will
    share the same "catalog" folder.  This means that their database files
    and cataloged images will be mixed within the same folder.

    Whenever the program runs, several AUTOMATIC backups are created.  If you
    have a program crash and lose your configuration or a database, these 
    files may be useful in restoring your system.

    system/darwin.cfg.bak
        a copy of the last successfully loaded configuration file.  If the
        program cannot find "system/darwin.cfg" or if it is corrupted, the
        program will automatically restore "system/darwin.cfg" from 
        "system/darwin.cfg.bak" -- If this fails a new initial distribution
        "system/darwin.cfg" file is created.  You may rebuild the list of
        KNOWN databases, by opening each in turn the next time you run the
        program.  Category naming schemes will have to be manually rebuilt
        and saved.

    system/lastLoadOf_xxx_yyy.db
        a copy of the "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" database file made
        as it was last loaded.  This copy does not contain any changes made 
        to the database while the program was running.

        If the "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" file is lost or becomes
        corrupted, you may manually restore the catalog (database) to the
        same state it was in when last loaded by manually replacing the 
        "surveyAreas/xxx/catalog/yyy.db" file with a COPY of the
        "system/lastLoadOf_xxx_yyy.db" file.

        If you have a more recent FULL BACKUP, you can accomplish the same
        thing by using the menu option "File/Restore" in the main window.
        FULL BACKUPS include all associated catalog images as well as the 
        *.db file.

Help / Documentation
--------------------
The "docs" folder contains an HTML User's Guide ("usersguide.htm").  You can
open it by double-clicking it, or you can access it from the menu option
"Help/Documentation" in the Main Window of the program.

Sample Catalog
--------------

There is a sample catalog included in the "surveyAreas/samples" folder. You
may find it useful to open this sample the first time you use the software.
All sample dolphin images have been provided courtesy of the Eckerd College
Dolphin Project.

Supported Image File Formats
----------------------------
The program currently reads JPEG, BMP, PNG, PNM, PGM(ASCII & Raw formats)
and PPM (Raw format) image files.  Other image formats will be supported
in future versions of the software as needs are identified.

EXIF data from JPEG files are automatically extracted and used to fill
sighting data entries wherever possible.  Currently the image creation
date/time is extracted and displayed when a new image is loaded into the
Trace Window for processing.

Backup & Restore
----------------
These processes are provided in the software beginning with version 1.85.
From the main window the user may make a backup of the CURRENTLY LOADED
database using the menu option "File/Backup."  The backup is created in
a standard location and is named automatically.  

Given the currently loaded database ...

    surveyAreas/default/catalog/darwin.db

a backup created today (5/15/2007) would be created as a zipped archive
containing the database file "darwin.db" and all associated images, and this
archive would be saved in the "backups" folder as ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007.zip

any subsequent backups created the same day would be stored with numeric 
suffixes as follows ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[2].zip
    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[3].zip

Backups must be manually removed when or if space becomes an issue.

If the user needs to restore a database from an existing backup, the menu 
option "File/Restore" from the main window allows selection of a backup 
file.  The catalog file and all associated images will be extracted from
the backup file (zipped archive) into exactly the same survey area from
which it came.

Given the selected backup archive ...

    backups/default_darwin_MAY_15_2007[2].zip

The database file itself ...

    surveyAreas/default/catalog/darwin.db 

would be replaced with the copy from the archive.  Any missing images
associated with the database in the folder ...

   surveyAreas/default/catalog/

would also be replaced from the archive.  However, existing images
in the catalog folder will NOT be overwritten.

Export & Import
----------------
These processes are provided in the software beginning with version 1.85.
They are similar to Backup and Restore.  However, the user is allowed 
wider control over the location and naming of the zipped archive when
exporting, and a completely new survey area is required when importing.
Export and import are intended to allow movement of a catalog (database)
from one machine to another or one installation to another.

From the main window the user may export the CURRENTLY LOADED database
using the menu option "File/Export."  A zipped archive containing the
database file and all associated images is created in a location and with
a name selected by the user.

From the main window the user may import an exported archive by using the
"File/Import" menu option.  The user must then select the archive file to
be imported AND enter a name for a new survey area within which to import
the catalog.  Imports into existing survey areas are not allowed in this
version of the software because of the difficulties associated with 
maintaining existing database associations with existing images while 
extracting large numbers of additional images into the catalog folder.

Security & Sharing Issues
------------------------
Windows XP (in particular) has tightened file sharing and security settings.
A "normal" User is likely to have problems running the Darwin software, even
if he succeeded in installing it.  This problem has to do with default 
"write"and "delete" privileges for normal users being denied in certain 
locations.

The main issues relate to the following ....

    All catalogs ("catalog/*.db") and the configuration file ("darwin.cfg")
    must be opened in read  and write modes since changes are made to it as
    the program runs.  A normal User may not have write privileges if the
    software was installed by a different user.

    If file write permissions are the problem the program will most likely
    terminate with an error message "Error opening or creating database 
    file!"

If you have "Administrator" or "Power User" privileges on your Windows XP 
machine you should not encounter these problems.

If not, you will need to use the Windows XP File Sharing and Security 
settings to permit "write" and "delete" access to the problem files.
