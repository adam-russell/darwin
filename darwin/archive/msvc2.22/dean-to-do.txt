Talked with Kelly on 10/14/2005

I need to do ...

1 - need a way to allow matching without categories
    in case user does not have categories
	OR user does not select category for fin prior to saving into database
    use a default category in trace window ... "Unspecified"?

    //***055DB DONE - JHS 10/24/2005 ***

2 - production matching dialog

3 - error still does not reflect real degree of misalignment
    some look great but have high error
	some look awful but have low error
	find way to determine how many lead & trail are being ignored and
	   create penalty for those?
	OR find way to determine degree of scaling being applied in registration
	   and penalize for amounts above some threshold (30% or more is bad?)

    //***055ER error now computed using ALL of fin outlines - JHS 10/24/2005

    could continue to work on penalty ......

4 - user changeable category list (new dialog)

5 - 1/10th method and return to rematch causes crash on some fins
    using order original, 1/10th, JHS tip, JHS notch, JHS all, JHS lead-then-trail, TOTAL

    *** CAN NOT DUPLICATE ***

Kelly will send numbers soon

Scott has fixed part of auto trace problem but not all

Kelly is still working on multi-scale snake
   Scale up between steps does not work correctly


Kelly's e-mail (10/14/2005) ...

Hi Dean,
   Just checking in.  I cannot remember when we agreed we would
connect again.  But again it is Friday and I have a minute to breathe.
Several points of update:

1.  I furnished Scott with a directory of images that locked up the
auto trace and another group that crashed it. Scott has now taken a 
look at the images and has not been able to repeat a lock up.  He did
identify and fix the cause of the crash.  Today I will update your
last code with his fixes to test and give back to him for more
investigation if the locking up is still an issue.

2.  With the images that caused no problems, I went ahead and 
constructed a database of 175 images.  I needed to get started on
some level of testing and it has been fruitful.  Boy, adding the 
category is extra work when building the database and it is not an
option.  If no images have a category assigned, no matching occurs.
I wonder if we should allow this category to be included in the search 
all option.  There are currently those using Finscan who don't refine
the search by category. I used the actual categories since I have
a list for most, for several I just did my best to pick a likely choice.
Our largest category is tip-nick with 31 - unfortunately only 6 of the
50 fins-to-match are tip-nick so I'm not sure how informative an
in-category search will be but I will try.

So far I have matched only 12 images against the database.  I am still
working out the best scenario for storing results files.  Results are
mixed if you look at just the numbers. (I'll update you after I grep and
group)  What it seems though is that certain methods do a fabulous job
of registering, but that doesn't always lead to a low numbered ranking.
There are still a couple of DB images that tend to have unknowns shrinked
to fit well and they rank well for lots of images.

Also, I have a problem roughly about half of the time, when I return to
select a new matching algorithm, if I am returning after the 1/10th
method, it crashes.  Therefore I test this one last so I don't need to
retrace.

3.  My multiscale is still not working.  It crashes.  There is some
scaling that is not working as I am expecting it to, so I am still
digging away at that.

4.  Along with adding Scott's newest changes, I need to make sure to
include the code for the bigger dots and bigger eraser (before I go
blind.)  Working on that as well today.

Well, that's the update.  Let me know when we plan to talk on the phone
next.

Kelly

ps.  I got an email that the poster guidelines have now been posted on
the website.
