Some things you might want to do in DARWIN:

// Stuff that should probably be changed:
* There should be a version of Contour::evenlySpaceContourPoints that
  returns a FloatContour.  It should be called in Match::findErrorBetweenFins
  to reduce a potential source of error.

// Questionable things you may want to look at:
* The function that finds the beginning of the leading edge only
  considers that a diverging section can angle upwards.

* Right now, the image added to the database is the originally opened
  image, not the processed version.  This may not be the right way to do things.

// Possible usability improvements: 
* Add a rotate dialog that asks the user for an angle.  (Doing the
  rotation interactively is too slow.)  Alternatively, add a simple,
  interactive grid that gets rotated instead of the image, like how
  the gimp does it. (This is far more complicated.)

* Add a nice little dialog to ask the user to enter a name, id code, and
  a damage category when he or she clicks the "No Fins Match" button in the
  MatchResultsWindow.

* Write a manual and make it accessible on the Help menu.  Probably the simplest
  way to do this is to write it in HTML, and do a system call to a web browser.
  You could use an #ifdef to help out ("WIN32" is defined by default when you
  compile in MSVC++).  There might be a really easy way using file association
  type stuff, but I haven't looked into it.
 
* Make it so MatchResultsWindow handles resizing better.  (or make it
  unresizable)
